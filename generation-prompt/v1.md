Your task is to develop a desktop utility that can be used on Linux desktops. Use Python and Pyqt 5 or 6 for the GUI. The functionality should be as follows. The user has the ability to upload a file from their computer. This can be an audio file of any kind so long as it is supported by the OpenAI Whisper API and uses the file picker. The user can upload only one file at a time. There should be a settings feature in the GUI in which the user can set their open AI, API key and this setting should persist Between uses so it can be saved as a memory module in the users doc config with a distinctive file name. Once the user has selected the file, there is a button that says Transcribe. When the user presses this button, the audio file is sent for transcription to open AI. 

The text which is received back from the API should populate in a text display area beneath that says Transcribed text. 

The user should be able to edit this transcribed text using the standard features available within a text box. 

Beneath the transcribed text there is another button. This says "Clean This Text."

If the user clicks on this button then the following occurs. For the system prompt which cleans up the transcribed text, use a JSON format with OpenAI to improve consistency:

- The text that was captured from the Whisper API is passed in a new API. Call this time to gpt-4o-mini
- The following system prompt is added: You are a text rewriting assistant. You will receive text that was captured and transcribed from speech to text processing. Your task is to edit this text for intelligibility and clarity. You should resolve any obvious typos. If you can identify in the text instructions to remove part of the transcribed text, such as "actually, delete that" Then you should action the intent, which you can infer from the instruction which was included in the transcript. You should also add paragraph spacing. You should use bullet points where it would be helpful to improve the intelligibility of the text. You should add headers where it would similarly make the text more readable. If there is repetition or redundancy in the text, then you can remove it in your improved version. Once you have applied these edits, you must return the edited text." 

Once the cleaned up text is returned from the API Then it should be presented in another text box beneath this one which has as its header label Cleaned Text

Similarly to the previous text box, the user should be able to edit this text. 

Finally there is a button that says Generate title. Pressing this button will send the transcribed text to open AI LLM with a system prompt close to this one:

- You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to generate a short title for the text. The title should summarize its main content. In addition to the display title, you must also generate a suggested file name. The file name should be similar to the main title, but it should be written in kebab case (no upper case, hyphens for space)

The prompt which is used to generate the title should also be supplied as JSON.

Each text field (transcribed, cleaned) should also have the following additional UI features:

- A clear button which will empty it of its contents. 
- A copy button which will copy it directly to the user's clipboard.   

There should also be a download button next to transcribed text and cleaned text. The following logic should apply:

- If the user has used the AI tool in order to generate a title, then the filename generated by the AI tool should be used
- If the user has not generated a title with AI, then the title can be a simple timestamp.

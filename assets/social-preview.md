# Creating a Social Media Preview Image

To create a social media preview image for your repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a PNG image with dimensions 1280Ã—640px (Twitter's recommended size)
2. Save the image as `social-preview.png` in the `assets` directory
3. The image should include:
   - The application name "Whisper Converter Linux"
   - A brief tagline like "Audio Transcription & Text Refinement for Linux"
   - Your logo or a simple icon representing the application
   - A clean, professional background

You can create this image using any graphic design tool like GIMP, Inkscape, or online tools like Canva.

Once created, GitHub will automatically use this image for social media previews if you set it as the repository's social preview image in Settings.
